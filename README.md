# weevil-16
This is a 16-bit operating system written in Assembly for the heck of it!

# How-to
You need only `nasm` to build the OS, using `make all`. `make run` will execute the kernel. Typing `help` will print available commands (just two for now). Typing `hex` will test a WIP function for printing numbers in hexadecimal form.

# Status
This was my first attempt of creating an 'OS' (a shell rather) in x86 Assembly, so don't expect much from it :]. If you want to see my second try using assembly, take a look at [fdos](https://www.github.com/Vik2015/fdos).
